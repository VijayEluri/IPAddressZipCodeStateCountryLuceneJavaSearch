If you have maven and windows, you jsut need to tweak a little bit: the bootstrap script just installs 2 jar files to your local repository.

To run:
1) bootstrap.sh
2) mvn test

This will:
1) Download the geospatial database of IP addresses with lat/lon data
2) Create a spatial lucene index for searching by a number of fields

It uses low memory as well.  Take a look at src/main/resources/project.properties for all the configuration options you can use.

TODO:
1) Just return the IDs and retrieve the data from a database
2) Get this working awesome with Postgresql's http://www.gissearch.com/
3) Learn more about this stuff
4) Tune this.  It takes about 5-10 minutes to make on my mac, but to write out 1 GB I know it can go faster.

I made this over the course of a day, so there's still plenty more of what it can do.

It'll create a directory called "index" which will contain all the lucene segment files needed.


How it works:
1) Checks to see if you want to download a new index
2) Downloads new data if needed
3) Uses SuperCSV to parse the data and put it in a queue for processing
4) Spawns off a configurable number of threads and grabs the data from the queue and writes it concurrently to the solr index writer
5) When the threads are done, the index writer commits the index
6) Happy geo searching.


What this can be used for:
I guess if you have some social website you can let users know who is close to you.  Kinda like what tweets are going near you at twitter.
